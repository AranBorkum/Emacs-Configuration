# Basic Overview:
  - Makes for a nice emcas environment for program development
  - Addition are easy to add through a .org file with simple key bindings
  
## Initialisation

The configurations can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/AranBorkum/Emacs-Configuration)
An important feature to consider is that the file `myDotEmacs.txt` must be renamed to `.emacs`. I would recomend doing this when you put the files in your `~/` directory.

## Important Shortcuts
  - `C-c e` will open the `config.org` file
  - `C-c r` will reload the configurations you've made 
  - `C-x r i` is bound to `string-insert-rectangle` because for some reason this doesn't exist
